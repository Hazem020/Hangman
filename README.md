# Hyperskill Hangman Project

[Hangman in Python][1] project from [Hyperskill][2].

# About
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!

# Learning outcomes
Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.
